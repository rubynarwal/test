   <p>Keep smiling, because life 
    is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.</p>
   <p>Simplicity requires a two-step process. First, we must invest time and energy to discover what stirs us as human beings, what makes our hearts sing, and what brings us joy. Then, we must proceed to create the life that reflects the unique people we truly are. 
    This is the heart and soul of simplicity. </p>
   <p>A life portfolio offers a compelling alternative to traditional retirement. It is a new way of thinking and living in extended middle age. A typical portfolio is a balanced mix of some work, ongoing learning, recreation, travel and avocations, 
    reconnecting with family and friends, and giving back.</p>
   <p>The foundation stones of honesty, character, faith, integrity, love, and loyalty are necessary for a balanced success that includes health, wealth, and happiness. As you go onward and upward in life, you will discover that if you compromise any of these principles you will end up with
     only a beggar's portion of what life has to offer.</p>
   <p>If you learn to develop an abundant mentality you will not be envious of others, you will celebrate their successes, you will share in their joys and pains.
     Don't see life as a competition but as complementary.</p>
